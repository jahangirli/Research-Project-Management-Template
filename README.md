# Welcome to Project A!


## Description of the project structure: 
- All file paths are relative. So, you just need to run them. No change of directory is required as long as you have the complete project repository cloned. 
- requirements.txt: contains all the necessary packages, etc. for running the project
- src: a folder for all the codes
- data: a folder for raw data
    - data/imputed: a folder for imputed or cleaned data
- output: a folder for all outputs
    - output/figures: a folder for figures
    - output/tables: a folder for tables
    - output/latex: a folder containing LaTeX template for paper and slides


## Describe your project here: 
Project A is to do X, Y, Z. Thus, derive properties to understand the problem B. 

## Remember: 
### QuantEconâ€™s "A Digression on Style and Naming":
- Code is read many more times than it is written
- Write code to be read in the future, not today
- Excess comments in code can make code harder to read
- Maintain the correspondence between the whiteboard math and the code


## Future improvements:
- Running code with Make and make correct meta-programming
- Unix/Linux shell commands
- Auto check of draft using self-created reviewing file contained in "output/latex/paper/reviewing"


## Disclaimer: 
This project management structure borrows heavily from Jonathan Dingel, Chad I. Jones, Arthur Turrell, and many others who made their codes or thoughts publicly available on the web. Thanks!
